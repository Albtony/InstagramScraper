# InstagramScraper <br>
A simple instagram scrapper built with selenium. This project was meant for fun only and intended to familiarize my self with selenium <br>
<br>
As of know this scrapper gets: <br>
1. profileName = profile username (not the @) <br>
2. profilePhoto = link of profile photo (cdn link, might not be presistent) <br>
3. numberOfPost = number of posts <br>
4. followerCount = number of followers accounts <br>
5. followingCount = number of followed accounts <br>
<br>
This side gig is discontinued because apparently this violates instagram policy XD, and now its kinda hard for me to test feature because IG might've blocked my devtools. So if i were to continue this gig, im probably going to build it with official instagram API. <br>
